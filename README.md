## how

It'll fetch a random emoji from a master list of edible emoji (to avoid faces & flags taking over all posts) then maybe throw in an adjective and then it makes a webpage out of it, screenshots it and tweets it.

I recommend reading the code itself, (start at `app.js`!) it's pretty straightforward and simpler than that mouthful of an explanation!!
